## Introduction
While I know I'm not the only one, it's still difficult for me to contain my excitement for the upcoming Animal Crossing: New Horizons.  As such, I built a very simple [React](https://reactjs.org) app which counts down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the release of ACNH on March 20, 2020.
